🚀 Excited to share my recent project: a Hotel Management System built using C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Data Structures! 🏨✨

🔧 Key Features:

🏨 Room Management: Efficiently handle room allocations, updates, and deletions.
🔍 Advanced Search: Search for rooms by ID, customer name, or allocated date.
🗄️ Database Integration: Connected to an SQLite database to handle all CRUD operations seamlessly.
🔒 Manager Authentication: Secure login to view and manage customer records and booking histories.
📊 Time Complexity: Calculated and displayed the time complexity for each operation to ensure optimal performance.

💡 Technical Highlights:

Used DB Browser for SQLite to manage database tables.
Leveraged the sqlite3 library for database connectivity.
Operations like insert, update, search, and delete interact with the backend database effectively.
The system initializes a linked list from the database and keeps it updated with each operation.                               This project not only enhanced my skills in C++ programming and database management but also taught me a lot about efficient data handling and performance optimization. 🚀

Feel free to connect if you have any questions or if you're interested in discussing this project further! 😊
